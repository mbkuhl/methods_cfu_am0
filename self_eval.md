# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?


    Pushing through the discomfort when researching, reading, and writing things that were slighly boring. The more I pushed, the more comfortable it became.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?


    Methods allow us to drastically shorten the amount of lines of code that we might use if we were to have to write down the set of instructions each time we wanted to use them. Being able to save a set of instructions that are commonly used, or pull upon someone else's sets that they have contributed to open source is powerful.
